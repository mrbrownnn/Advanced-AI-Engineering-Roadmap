# Graduation — Architecture Review

## Purpose

Graduation is a comprehensive architecture review under realistic constraints: ambiguous requirements, incomplete information, security constraints, SLOs, budget limits, and growth projections.

## What Is Tested

- Ambiguous requirements → structured assumptions
- Incomplete telemetry → identifying what's missing
- Quality constraints → evaluation strategy
- SLO targets → capacity and scheduling design
- Security constraints → threat modeling and defense
- GPU/resource budget → economic optimization
- Growth projection → scaling strategy

## Expected Reasoning Pattern

```
Unknowns → Assumptions → Hypotheses → Quantitative Model
→ Measurements → Experiments → Falsification
→ Architecture → Economics → Risks
→ Migration → Rollback → Defense
```

## Status

🏗️ **Skeleton only.** Graduation scenarios will be developed alongside the capstone.
