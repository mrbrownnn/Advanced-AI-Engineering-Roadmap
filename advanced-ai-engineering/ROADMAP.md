# Roadmap — 26 Weeks

The schedule is planned in hours, not one module per week. The global budget is 730–780 hours over 26 weeks (≈28–30 h/week). Module hours come from each module's `estimated_effort.total`.

## Budget Check

- Authored Modules 00–24: **665h**.
- Capstone war week and graduation: ≈50h.
- Continuous capstone work in weeks 6–24 at ≈2–3 h/week: ≈40–55h.
- Program total: **≈755–770h**, inside the 730–780h budget.

## Pacing Notes

- **Weeks 13–17 combine six modules.** Modules 12–17 are each 24h; placing them in five weeks (≈28.8 h/week) keeps the load within the weekly budget and frees one week so all 25 modules fit before the capstone week. Module boundaries are kept; only the calendar is shared.
- Weeks 7–12 carry the heaviest single modules (30–32h); expect those weeks to run slightly over 30h, or borrow time from the continuous capstone allowance.
- Weeks 20–24 use the audited effort of the now-authored modules (23.5–25.5h each).
- Capstone development runs continuously from Week 6; Week 25 is integration, load testing, failure injection, and defense.

## Progressive Integration

- **Evidence discipline** — methodology from Module 00 applied in every lab.
- **Observability** — introduced in Modules 02 and 04, deepened in every module, dedicated Module 23.
- **Security** — surfaces in agents, harnesses, and retrieval before the dedicated Module 18.
- **Capstone** — absorbs artifacts from Module 04 onward.
