# Curriculum Index

Module IDs, titles, and paths match the directories in this folder. Effort is each module's audited `estimated_effort.total`.

All Modules 00–24 are **authored** against the [instructional schema](INSTRUCTIONAL_SCHEMA.md), with an evidence registry, knowledge model, engineering labs, incident scenario, mastery assessment, and pinned production source trace.

## Capstone and Graduation

| Item | Description |
|---|---|
| [Capstone](capstone/) | AI Runtime Platform — progressive integration of module artifacts |
| [Graduation](graduation/) | Architecture review under ambiguous requirements and constraints |

## Effort Summary

- All 25 authored modules: **665h** of declared module effort.
- Program total including continuous capstone and graduation: **≈755–770h**. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the week plan.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

These topics are not confined to a single module:

- **Evidence discipline** — O/D/H separation and measurement design from Module 00 apply in every lab.
- **Observability** — timing and profiling from Module 02, request metrics from Module 04, and the dedicated Module 23.
- **Security** — authority policy in Module 12, validation in Module 13, the dedicated Module 18, and training-time poisoning in Module 19.
- **Economics** — cost terms appear from Module 04 onward; the dedicated Module 22.
- **Failure analysis** — every module includes break/falsify labs and an incident scenario.
