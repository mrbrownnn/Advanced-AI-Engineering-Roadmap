# Module 23 — Observability & Reliability

## 00 Why This Module Exists

A green dashboard can accompany a failing service. Successful exported spans omit rejected work, crashed workers, unfinished requests, and dropped telemetry. A judge score can move while true quality does not. A trace can detect failure yet omit evidence needed to localize origin. Reliability therefore starts with measurement contracts, not dashboards.

This module owns production telemetry boundaries, trace continuity and sampling, offered-outcome reliability, SLO burn control, delayed quality signals, telemetry governance, and incident discrimination. Serving metric mechanics stay in Module 04; evaluation design in Module 15; rollout and rollback-state compatibility in Module 17; security detection in Module 18; full cost modeling in Module 22.

**Research cutoff:** 2026-09-30.

**Module Orientation**
- **Engineering Problem**: Build evidence that remains interpretable when requests retry, cancel, remain unfinished, lose telemetry, or receive delayed quality labels.
- **What You Will Do**: Define signal contracts; trace pinned OpenTelemetry GenAI conventions; propagate context; simulate biased sampling and censoring; build offered-outcome SLIs and burn alerts; calibrate proxy-quality signals; budget telemetry; and execute a mitigation-first incident runbook.
- **Environment**: Python 3.10+, a small trace/ledger simulator, optional OpenTelemetry Collector. All fixtures are synthetic unless marked source observation.
- **Evidence Rule**: Registry claims appear as source observation **O**, derivation **D**, or hypothesis **H** with `CLM-###`. Detector output, LLM-judge output, and embedding distance are instrument readings, never ground truth.

## 01 Baseline Assumptions

- Module 04 Lessons 4.1, 4.4, 4.6: latency boundaries, censoring semantics, admission/rejection, and offered versus admitted populations.
- Module 08 Lesson 8.6: annotation systems and delayed human labels.
- Module 15: grader validation, slices, intervals, and offline/online validity.
- Module 16: fault injection and falsification.
- Module 17: canaries, rollback triggers, and rollback-state compatibility.
- Module 18: security detectors and protected telemetry. This module governs their signals; it does not design attacks.
- Modules 12–14: trajectory, retry, effect, and recovery telemetry.

### LAYER 1: KNOWLEDGE / INSTRUCTIONAL LAYER

## 03 Knowledge Map

Offered request → ingress ledger → logical operation and attempts → propagated trace context → spans/events/metrics → sampling/export pipeline → terminal-state reconciliation → offered-outcome SLI → error budget and burn alerts → fast proxy plus mature delayed quality labels → governed storage → mitigation, discrimination, rollback, and remeasurement.

Cross-cutting invariants: every number declares boundary, population, units, aggregation, window, failure/cancellation/unfinished treatment, sampling probability, and schema revision; missing telemetry is unknown, not success.

## 04 Lessons

### Lesson 23.1 — Signal Contracts and Pinned GenAI Conventions

**Engineering Question:**
What does each span, event, and metric measure, and which schema revision makes its name interpretable?

**Concepts & Definitions:**
- A **span** times one operation and preserves causal links; an **event** records a timestamped occurrence; a **metric** is an aggregate that has lost request identity.
- A **logical client span** may cover retries; attempt child spans/events preserve attempt detail. Client, server, and attempt clocks are not interchangeable (**O**, CLM-004, CLM-005; **D**, CLM-011).
- At core semantic-conventions commit `70550277d98a01ca3fe83bcfc3a2dac18a0d98b7`, GenAI definitions are moved/deprecated. At `semantic-conventions-genai` commit `b31e9e8ea26ac1c086d3313d474e31d7c3f391ae`, inspected GenAI spans, metrics, events, and attributes are **Development**, not Stable (**O**, CLM-001, CLM-002, CLM-003). Production mappings must record revision.
- Finish reasons preserve error/cancellation positions; operation status does not imply answer quality (**O**, CLM-006, CLM-044). Token histograms and counters have different aggregation contracts (**O**, CLM-010).

**Mechanism Explanation:**
At request start, create a logical operation span with sampling-eligible attributes. Each retry gets attempt evidence. Evaluation results are events correlated by response ID, not truth labels (**O**, CLM-009). At completion, record declared terminal state, latency, usage, and schema revision. Metrics aggregate bounded dimensions; the ledger retains request identity.

**Quantitative Model / Derivation:**
For 121 client chunks, mean per-output-chunk time is `(last-first)/(121-1)`. Server TPOT similarly divides post-first-token duration by output-token gaps. These are exact only at their named clocks and populations.

**Worked Example (synthetic):**
Input: logical client span 3.650 s; attempt 1 fails at 0.600 s; retry starts 0.650 s; first client chunk at 1.250 s; last at 3.650 s; server receives retry at 0.670 s, first token after 0.560 s, and 241 tokens finish after 2.960 s server duration.
1. Client time to first chunk from logical start = 1.250 s; from retry = 0.600 s.
2. Client mean chunk gap = `(3.650-1.250)/120 = 0.020 s`.
3. Server TPOT = `(2.960-0.560)/240 = 0.010 s`.
4. A `(0.64,1.28]` TTFC histogram bucket cannot recover retry or server decomposition.
Result: no valid subtraction converts client TTFC into server TTFT. Limit: synthetic clocks; unsynchronized clock skew needs separate measurement.

**Knowledge Check:**
1. Why can one successful logical span contain a failed attempt? 2. Why cannot span status serve as quality truth? 3. Are pinned GenAI attributes stable?

**Guided Practice:**
Write contracts for one logical span, attempt event, evaluation event, and offered-request counter. Include timestamps, population, units, aggregation, terminal states, and revision.

**Feedback Contract:**
- **Expected Evidence**: Four contracts; explicit logical/attempt boundary; exact commits; Development label.
- **Common Failure**: Calling experimental/Development attributes stable or equating client and server latency.
- **Diagnostic Hint**: Ask which clock starts and which population can disappear.
- **Concept to Revisit**: Signal boundary and convention stability.

**Learning Outcome:** Define versioned trace, event, and metric contracts without boundary collapse.

### Lesson 23.2 — Propagation, Sampling, Telemetry Loss, and Censoring

**Engineering Question:**
How can trace continuity and rate estimates survive retries, sampling, late spans, exporter loss, crashes, and window closure?

**Concepts & Definitions:**
- W3C `traceparent` version 00 carries trace ID, parent ID, and flags; sampled is a propagation signal, not completeness proof (**O**, CLM-012).
- Head sampling uses creation-time facts; tail sampling can use outcomes but waits, buffers, evicts, and may split late spans (**O**, CLM-007, CLM-013, CLM-014, CLM-016, CLM-017).
- Batch processors can drop after queue limits; deployed settings, not specification defaults, govern reality (**O**, CLM-015).
- **Censoring**: unfinished, crashed, cancelled, or unexported work lacks an observed terminal span. It is neither a negative label nor success.

**Mechanism Explanation:**
Propagate context gateway → orchestrator → retrieval/provider/tool. Record request, trace, operation, and attempt IDs in a reliability ledger, never as unbounded metric labels. Reconcile ingress offered records with terminal ledger rows and export counters. If inclusion probability is known, use adjusted counts; if eviction adds unknown selection, report non-identifiability.

**Quantitative Model / Derivation:**
`P(observe at least one of k rare events)=1-(1-p)^k`. With unequal inclusion probabilities, estimate a rate as `Σ(y_i/p_i)/Σ(1/p_i)` only when every `p_i` is known and no extra censoring exists.

**Worked Example (synthetic; D):**
One million offered requests contain 40 rare failures. At `p=0.01`, expected sampled failures = 0.4 and visibility is `1-0.99^40=0.331` (**D**, CLM-018). Tail policy keeps all 40 failures and 1% of 999,960 successes: exported count ≈10,039.6; naive failure share `40/10039.6=0.398%`, versus true `0.004%`. Weighting failures by 1 and successes by 100 recovers `40/1,000,000=0.004%`. If 500 crashed workers never end spans, span-only correction cannot recover them (**D**, CLM-019).

**Knowledge Check:**
1. Why is sampled=true not proof all child spans arrived? 2. When is inverse-probability weighting invalid? 3. What population contains crashed requests?

**Guided Practice:**
Simulate 1,000 windows and test the predicted zero-observation fraction, naive tail bias, adjusted rate, and ingress reconciliation (**H**, CLM-042).

**Feedback Contract:**
- **Expected Evidence**: Seeded simulator; expected 0.669 zero windows; adjusted and unadjusted estimates; explicit eviction counter.
- **Common Failure**: Dividing sampled failures by sampled traces after outcome-dependent selection.
- **Diagnostic Hint**: Can every missing trace be assigned a known inclusion probability?
- **Concept to Revisit**: Censoring versus sampling.

**Learning Outcome:** Quantify propagation, sampling, export, and censoring bias and state when correction is impossible.

### Lesson 23.3 — Offered-Outcome SLIs

**Engineering Question:**
Which denominator represents user-visible reliability when work is rejected, cancelled, unfinished, slow, malformed, or low quality?

**Concepts & Definitions:**
- SLI is good events / eligible total events; SLO is target; error budget is `1-SLO` (**O**, CLM-020).
- **Offered denominator** contains every eligible ingress request, before admission.
- **Good predicate** declares terminal success plus latency/schema/policy checks and, when mature, validated quality.
- Cancellations and unfinished requests are included, excluded by declared policy with sensitivity, or bounded—never silently dropped.

**Mechanism Explanation:**
Ingress writes every offered request. Terminal reconciliation assigns rejection, success, explicit error, timeout, cancellation, or unfinished-at-close. The SLI joins outcome checks. Trace-derived success is a diagnostic view, not reliability denominator.

**Quantitative Model / Derivation:**
`SLI_offered=good/offered`. With `u` unfinished and `g` known good, bounds are `[g/N,(g+u)/N]`. Exclusion sensitivity recomputes both numerator and denominator under the declared policy.

**Worked Example (synthetic; D, CLM-021):**
Input: 120,000 offered; 6,000 rejected; 108,300 completed OK; 1,140 errors; 2,280 timeouts; 1,710 cancellations; 570 unfinished; 104,000 pass latency and schema.
1. Completion-conditioned success = `108300/109440=98.96%`.
2. Admitted completion = `108300/114000=95.00%`.
3. Offered completion = `108300/120000=90.25%`.
4. Offered-outcome good = `104000/120000=86.67%`.
5. Excluding cancellations = `104000/118290=87.92%`.
6. Unfinished bounds = `[104000,104570]/120000=[86.67%,87.14%]`.
Limit: cancellations may be caused by slowness; exclusion can hide harm.

**Knowledge Check:**
1. Why can admitted latency look healthy during mass rejection? 2. How should unfinished requests appear? 3. When may quality join the primary SLI?

**Guided Practice:**
Design availability/latency and mature-quality predicates for a streaming endpoint; include retry ownership, cancellation sensitivity, and window closure.

**Feedback Contract:**
- **Expected Evidence**: Recomputable ledger query and four denominator views.
- **Common Failure**: Counting only ended exported spans.
- **Diagnostic Hint**: Start from ingress IDs and account for every terminal bucket.
- **Concept to Revisit**: Offered versus admitted populations.

**Learning Outcome:** Build offered-outcome SLIs with explicit cancellation and unfinished-work policy.

### Lesson 23.4 — Error Budgets and Multiwindow Burn Alerts

**Engineering Question:**
How should alert thresholds be recomputed for this SLO, window, traffic level, and response time?

**Concepts & Definitions:**
- Allowance `a=1-S`; burn rate `B=e/a`; burn 1 exhausts budget exactly over SLO period.
- Multiwindow alerts pair a long budget-consumption window with a short active-burn window. Workbook values 14.4/6/1 are starting points for a 99.9%, 30-day example, not constants (**O**, CLM-022).
- Low traffic needs counts/intervals, separate synthetics, or a longer/combined population; one failure can be a noisy page (**O**, CLM-024).

**Mechanism Explanation:**
Choose page-value budget fractions and response windows, derive burn, convert to error ratio, verify `B≤1/a`, require both windows, and add minimum-event or uncertainty treatment. Keep synthetics separate from real-user SLIs.

**Quantitative Model / Derivation:**
Budget fraction consumed over `w` is `Bw/T`; constant-rate exhaustion is `T/B`; approximate fire time after outage onset is `(a/e)wB` plus evaluation and notification delay.

**Worked Example (synthetic arithmetic; D, CLM-023):**
For 30 days = 720 h: 2%/1 h gives `B=14.4`; 5%/6 h gives `B=6`; 10%/72 h gives `B=1`. At SLO 99%, thresholds are 14.4%, 6%, 1%. A 30% error ratio burns 30×, exhausts in 24 h, and reaches the 1 h page after `0.01/0.30×60×14.4=28.8 min`. At SLO 90%, maximum burn is 10, so a 14.4× alert is impossible. At 10 req/h and 99.9%, one hourly failure is 100× burn and consumes `1/7.2=13.9%` of monthly budget—not 1,000×.

**Knowledge Check:**
1. Why does maximum burn depend on SLO? 2. Why require long and short windows? 3. Why can synthetic success not repair real-user reliability?

**Guided Practice:**
For SLO 99.5%, derive thresholds for 2%/1 h and 5%/6 h, expected fire times for 20% errors, and low-traffic behavior at 30 requests/hour.

**Feedback Contract:**
- **Expected Evidence**: `a=.005`; burns 14.4 and 6; error thresholds 7.2% and 3%; explicit count treatment.
- **Common Failure**: Copying thresholds or paging on a percentage with one event.
- **Diagnostic Hint**: Check maximum burn and actual event count first.
- **Concept to Revisit**: Error allowance and budget fraction.

**Learning Outcome:** Derive multiwindow burn policies and low-traffic safeguards from first principles.

### Lesson 23.5 — Proxy Quality and Delayed Labels

**Engineering Question:**
How can fast detectors support operations without being promoted to ground truth?

**Concepts & Definitions:**
- Judge, detector, and embedding-distance outputs are proxy readings. Validate against independent adjudication; version evaluator and rubric; report slices and uncertainty (**O**, CLM-025, CLM-028, CLM-029, CLM-039).
- A GenAI evaluation event transports a score; it does not carry validated error rates (**O**, CLM-009).
- Recent unlabeled outcomes are right-censored. Compare mature cohorts or model delay from mature data (**O**, CLM-030).
- Prediction-powered inference is an alternative using labeled and unlabeled target samples; registry inspection is abstract-level (**O**, CLM-027).

**Mechanism Explanation:**
Fast proxies page or prioritize review. A separate mature quality SLI joins independent labels by response ID and cohort age. Calibration correction requires invariant conditional judge behavior; new failure mixes invalidate it.

**Quantitative Model / Derivation:**
With sensitivity `q1`, specificity `q0`, and raw pass `p`, corrected prevalence is `(p+q0-1)/(q0+q1-1)`, requiring `q0+q1>1` and invariance. Delayed-positive estimate at age `d` is `n_d/(N F(d))`. Detector PPV is `πs/[πs+(1-π)FPR]`.

**Worked Example (synthetic; D):**
Calibration: `q1=.92`, `q0=.80`. Raw pass `.88` corrects to `.68/.72=.944`; `.82` to `.62/.72=.861`, so raw 6 points understates corrected 8.3 points (**D**, CLM-026). A new accepted failure type can make stale correction read `.919` while truth is `.860`; proxy is not truth. Separately, 150 complaints among 10,000 day-old outcomes with `F(1d)=.5` estimate `150/(10000×.5)=3%`, not 1.5%. At 2% incident prior, sensitivity .9 and FPR .1 give PPV `.018/.116=.155` (**D**, CLM-031).

**Knowledge Check:**
1. What invariance makes correction valid? 2. Why are missing recent complaints not negatives? 3. Can drift detection identify harm?

**Guided Practice:**
Create two weekly cohorts, inject a judge-accepted failure slice, and compare raw, corrected, and human-audited rates with evaluator/rubric versions.

**Feedback Contract:**
- **Expected Evidence**: Confusion matrix, correction and interval inputs, cohort maturity, slice audit.
- **Common Failure**: Calling judge or embedding distance ground truth.
- **Diagnostic Hint**: Recompute `P(proxy|truth)` by slice and week.
- **Concept to Revisit**: Conditional invariance and delayed censoring.

**Learning Outcome:** Operate proxy-quality and delayed-label systems with calibration limits explicit.

### Lesson 23.6 — Telemetry Governance and Incident Discrimination

**Engineering Question:**
How do we keep telemetry affordable and private while preserving enough evidence to mitigate and discriminate incidents?

**Concepts & Definitions:**
- Each unique metric-label combination is a series; unbounded IDs do not belong on metric labels (**O**, CLM-033). OpenTelemetry specifies filtering before a default 2,000-point cardinality limit and an overflow series, subject to SDK support (**O**, CLM-032).
- Prompt/output content is sensitive and large, off by default; an external content hook may run regardless of trace sampling (**O**, CLM-008). Data minimization and collector filtering/redaction remain implementer duties (**O**, CLM-034).
- Incident loop: symptom → competing hypotheses → missing evidence → discriminating measurement → ranked explanation → intervention → remeasurement. Stop bleeding and preserve evidence before prolonged root-cause work (**O**, CLM-036).
- Detection is not localization; controlled synthetic research reports this gap but is abstract-level and not a production rate (**O**, CLM-038).

**Mechanism Explanation:**
Filter labels before aggregation, observe overflow, sample trace envelopes and content independently, and separate access/retention. During a page, verify telemetry completeness, apply safe mitigation, preserve ledgers/config revisions, then discriminate provider, deployment, sampling/export, censoring, and quality-proxy hypotheses. Roll back only when Module 17 state compatibility permits.

**Quantitative Model / Derivation:**
Series upper bound is the product of retained cardinalities. Trace volume = requests × sample fraction × spans/request × bytes/span. Content uses its own capture probability.

**Worked Example (synthetic; D, CLM-035):**
Labels `3 models×2 providers×5 operations×5 errors×6 regions×4 tiers=3,600` series/metric; adding 500 tenants yields 1.8M. At 1M requests/day, 12 spans×1.2 KB = 14.4 GB/day unsampled. Content 26 KB/request = 26 GB/day. Over 30 days with traces at 1% but content hook at 100%: traces 4.32 GB + content 780 GB = 784.32 GB. Sampling traces alone misses budget and privacy target.

Mitigation arithmetic: at 99% SLO and burn 30, page at 28.8 min has consumed 2%; a 6-minute rollback adds 0.42%, totaling 2.42%. Diagnosing 45 minutes first totals 5.54% (**D**, CLM-037). Limit: rollback may be unsafe or irrelevant.

**Knowledge Check:**
1. Why does trace sampling not bound content capture? 2. What evidence distinguishes telemetry loss from traffic loss? 3. When should rollback not be first mitigation?

**Guided Practice:**
Given provider errors, exporter drops, a new evaluator rubric, and a deployment change, write predicted telemetry for each, a safe mitigation, and one discriminating query.

**Feedback Contract:**
- **Expected Evidence**: Cardinality/volume ledger; privacy controls; four hypotheses with predicted signals; rollback compatibility check.
- **Common Failure**: Long diagnosis before mitigation, or treating an alert dimension as origin.
- **Diagnostic Hint**: Compare ingress counts, terminal ledger, exporter counters, deployment and evaluator versions.
- **Concept to Revisit**: Telemetry completeness and mitigation-first triage.

**Learning Outcome:** Govern telemetry and execute mitigation-first, evidence-preserving incident discrimination.

- **Objective**: Instrument a synthetic gateway→orchestrator→provider/tool path; emit logical/attempt evidence and a revisioned mapping layer; complete Section 09 trace.
- **Hypothesis**: Revisioned mappings preserve queries across a simulated attribute rename; hard-coded queries break.
- **Variables**: retry, cancellation, propagation break, convention revision, content opt-in.
- **Measurements**: orphan rate, contract completeness, query parity, content bytes.
- **Break/Falsify**: Remove `traceparent`, cancel a stream, rename one Development attribute, enable a content hook under 1% trace sampling.
- **Alignment**: Lessons 23.1, 23.6. **Effort**: 3h; source trace separate.

### LAB D — Calibrated Quality with Delayed Labels
- **Objective**: Join evaluator events to independent delayed labels and compare raw, corrected, mature, and slice rates.

- **Variables**: failure mix, label delay, rubric version, calibration size.
- **Measurements**: q0/q1, raw/corrected/audited rate, interval coverage, slice errors, maturity.
- **Break/Falsify**: Change rubric and inject a novel failure; never call judge, detector, or embedding distance truth.
- **Alignment**: Lesson 23.5. **Effort**: 3h.

## 07 Break / Incident Scenarios

### Incident 23.1 — Green Spans, Red Users

**Synthetic symptoms:** At 10:05 a deployment changes retry and evaluator configuration. Offered requests remain 20k/min. Exported successful spans show 99.4%; offered good falls to 70%; exporter queue drops rise; cancellations triple; raw judge pass stays 91%; complaints are immature. 1% traces show provider timeouts, but tail sampling keeps errors. State-compatible rollback is available.

**Diagnostic Protocol:**
1. **Mitigate and preserve**: verify compatibility, shift 50% traffic to prior deployment, freeze configs, preserve ingress/terminal/export/evaluator revisions.
2. **Competing hypotheses**: provider fault; retry amplification; deployment defect; exporter loss; tail-sampling selection; cancellation censoring; stale judge calibration.
3. **Missing evidence**: offered/admitted/terminal counts, attempt count, unfinished age, inclusion policy, collector eviction/drop, deployment split, mature labels.
4. **Discriminating tests**: compare old/new deployment at same offered mix; ingress versus terminal versus exported; attempts/logical operation; raw versus adjusted traces; evaluator confusion matrix by slice.
5. **Ranked explanation**: permit interacting causes; detection alone is not localization.
6. **Intervention**: complete rollback if new deployment is causal; otherwise traffic shift/degradation. Repair telemetry separately from service.
7. **Remeasure**: offered good, burn, attempt amplification, cancellations, unfinished bounds, completeness, and mature quality on same population.

Expected runbook telemetry is defined in LAB C, making each synthetic fault testable rather than narrative.

1. Signal dictionary with boundaries, clocks, populations, terminal states, revision, and pinned source trace.
2. Offered/admitted/completed/useful-good ledger query with cancellation sensitivity and unfinished bounds.
3. Two-tier multiwindow burn policy, recomputed thresholds, maximum-burn check, and premium-tenant low-traffic policy.
4. Sampling plan with adjusted-count conditions, telemetry-completeness SLI, and one non-identifiable case.
5. Quality plan: confusion matrix, corrected estimate, uncertainty inputs, delay maturity, rubric/evaluator version, and novel-failure falsifier.
6. Cardinality, trace/content volume, privacy, access, and retention budget under 600 GB.
7. Incident 23.1 execution: mitigation, evidence, discriminating tests, ranked diagnosis, rollback verification, and remeasurement.
8. Synthetic fault suite with expected telemetry for provider error, timeout, rejection, stall, exporter loss, propagation break, and silent quality regression.
9. O/D/H evidence ledger and `TODO_VERIFY` list.

## 09 Required Evidence & Rubric

**Required artifacts:** source trace; signal dictionary; request/terminal ledger; SLI and alert code; sampling simulator; calibration/delay workbook; governance budget; incident timeline; fault assertions.

**Reference checks:** calibration `q1=230/250=.92`, `q0=117/150=.78`, denominator `.70`; corrected quality `(.84+.78-1)/.70=.8857`. Metric series with tenant = `4×2×4×8×5×6×1200=7,372,800`; without tenant = 6,144. Unsampled traces = `20M×9×1.5KB=270GB`; unsampled content = 600GB, already the full budget before trace/storage overhead. Any feasible plan must default content off or reduce it independently.

| Dimension | Insufficient | Competent | Strong |
|---|---|---|---|
| Boundaries | Mixes clocks/populations | Declares every signal contract | Tests retry, cancel, unfinished, and revision drift |
| Reliability | Uses ended spans | Offered ledger and bounded censoring | Sensitivity plus completeness and retry ownership |
| Alerting | Copies thresholds | Recomputes burn/windows/counts | Simulates detection/reset and low traffic |
| Quality | Proxy equals truth | Calibration and mature labels | Slice drift, intervals, and novel-failure falsifier |
| Governance | Samples traces only | Cardinality/volume/privacy budget | Enforced overflow, independent content control, access/retention |
| Incident | Guesses root cause | Mitigates, discriminates, remeasures | Handles interacting causes and failed rollback |
| Source reasoning | Unpinned names | Exact revisions/files/status | Mapping layer plus static/executed limits |

| Evidence discipline | all | all | D9 | O/D/H ledger and TODO_VERIFY |

## 11 Exit Criteria & Module Wrap-Up

A learner can exit when they can:
1. Define signal boundaries and pin Development-status GenAI conventions without calling them stable.
2. Propagate context and quantify sampling, telemetry-loss, retry, cancellation, and unfinished-request bias.
3. Build an offered-outcome SLI and derive multiwindow alerts for the actual SLO and traffic.
4. Keep detector, judge, and embedding signals separate from independent truth and delayed-label maturity.
5. Budget metric cardinality, trace bytes, content bytes, privacy, access, and retention.
6. Mitigate first, preserve evidence, discriminate causes, verify rollback, and remeasure completeness.

**Final mental model:** Reliability evidence begins at offered ingress, not exported success. Traces explain individual causal paths; events record occurrences; metrics aggregate bounded populations; ledgers reconcile what telemetry can lose. Sampling saves cost but changes inference. Quality proxies accelerate response but never become ground truth. During incidents, preserve evidence and stop harm, then use measurements that separate hypotheses.
