# Advanced AI Engineering

A competency-driven, 26-week advanced AI engineering program.

## What This Is

A structured curriculum for engineers at Junior+ / SFIA Level 4 targeting strong Middle / SFIA Level 5 technical capability, with selected SFIA Level 6 stretch exercises.

The program covers the complete chain from scientific experimentation through production AI systems:

```
Scientific Experimentation → Foundation Model Internals → Inference GPU Fundamentals
→ KV Cache Engineering → Serving / Scheduling / Capacity → Inference Optimization
→ Reasoning / Test-Time Compute → Model Behavior / Uncertainty → AI Data Engineering
→ Retrieval → Advanced RAG → Context / Memory → Agent Loops → Harnesses
→ Durable Agent Runtime → Evaluation → Falsification → Harness Evolution
→ AI Security → Model Adaptation → Distributed Inference → Multimodal Systems
→ AI Economics → Observability / Reliability → Model-System Co-design → Capstone
```

### Central Principle

```
BUILD → MEASURE → BREAK → EXPLAIN → IMPROVE → DEFEND
```

A system merely "working" is **not** considered completion.

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ A beginner AI course
- ❌ A framework tutorial collection
- ❌ A paper-reading list
- ❌ An LLM application tutorial
- ❌ An interview-cramming repository

## Learning Loop

Every module follows this default loop:

```
Concept → Paper / Official Documentation → Source Reading → Small Implementation
→ Instrument → Benchmark → Break → Diagnose → Optimize → Benchmark Again
→ Engineering Decision → Engineering Report
```

The learner should repeatedly answer:

- What did I assume?
- What did I predict?
- What did I measure?
- How reliable is the measurement?
- What broke?
- Why did it break?
- What evidence supports the explanation?
- What alternatives exist?
- What trade-off did I choose?
- Under what workload would the decision change?
- What is the rollback condition?

## Getting Started

1. Read [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the 26-week schedule
2. Read [CURRICULUM.md](CURRICULUM.md) for the module index
3. Read [COMPETENCY.md](COMPETENCY.md) for the competency framework
4. Start with [00-scientific-ai-engineering/](00-scientific-ai-engineering/) before any other module
5. Use [Module 04](04-serving-scheduling-capacity/README.md) as the structural reference and [INSTRUCTIONAL_SCHEMA.md](INSTRUCTIONAL_SCHEMA.md) for the module contract

## Conventions

- All competency metadata uses the format defined in [COMPETENCY.md](COMPETENCY.md)
- Engineering reports follow [templates/engineering-report.md](templates/engineering-report.md)
- Checkpoints follow [templates/checkpoint.md](templates/checkpoint.md)
- Benchmark results are append-only; never overwrite inconvenient results
- Source reading exercises pin a specific commit/tag

## Status

Modules 00–19 are authored against the [instructional schema](INSTRUCTIONAL_SCHEMA.md), each with a research registry and knowledge model, and are being corrected under the audit in [`../audit.md`](../audit.md). Modules 20–24 are outlines and are not yet curriculum content. Run `python tools/validate_curriculum.py` for the static checks; passing them does not certify technical correctness.
