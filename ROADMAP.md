# Roadmap — 26 Weeks

## Three Tracks

| Track | Depth | Duration |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Core** | Deep professional competency | 26 weeks continuous |
| **Satellite** | 80/20 architectural literacy | Integrated months 2–5 |
| **Paper Radar** | Continuous literature awareness | Ongoing |

> **Satellite tracks are NOT prerequisites for most core modules.** They provide breadth alongside the core's depth.

## Capstone

Capstone development runs continuously from Week 6. Each module produces artifacts that feed into the capstone AI Runtime Platform.

## Paper Radar

Continuous literature awareness maintained through the [paper-library/](paper-library/). New papers are triaged using the CANONICAL / PRODUCTION / FRONTIER / HISTORICAL / UNVALIDATED classification.
